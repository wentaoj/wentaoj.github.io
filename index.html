                    <h2> About </h2>
                     <p>
                        I am well-versed in Python, Java, C, and proficient in other languages like SQL, PHP and JavaScript. I have a foundational framework for advanced mathematics in discrete structures, probability and math stats, linear algebra, differential equations, operations research, numerical analysis, and graph theory. The courses have brought utter enjoyment and I devote a considerable amount of time on algorithms, programming, and studying math problems every day and night. Overcoming problems has provided me a great sense of accomplishment and even more passion. I am more convinced that the world of engineering and mathematics is wonderful, and this has exactly become the source of my interest.
